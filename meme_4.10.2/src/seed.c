 * score > seed2 score, then seed1 > seed2. If the two seeds have an identical
 * score, then they are compared on the basis of when they were created. This is
 * determined by examining the serial numbers of the two seeds. If seed1 is
 * older than seed2, than seed1 > seed2. If seed1 is newer than seed2, then
 * seed1 < seed2. If both seeds have equal creation times (eg if one was
 * generated by copying the other), then seed1 == seed2.
