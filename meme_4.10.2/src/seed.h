 * $Log$
 * Revision 1.1.2.12  2006/03/10 06:58:01  twhitington
 * print_heaps and "eval_best_seed" command line switches added.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.11  2006/03/02 04:55:15  twhitington
 * Removed old FIXME comment regarding string and integer rep storage.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.10  2006/03/02 04:31:12  twhitington
 * Changed get_w to get_width.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.9  2006/02/22 01:53:32  twhitington
 * Changed SEED objects so they don't store e_seed, and are instantiated with
 * ascii strings instead of encoded representations.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.8  2006/02/01 02:26:04  twhitington
 * Changed formal parameter names in seed.h.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.7  2006/02/01 01:38:46  twhitington
 * Modified subseq7 so that Tcm make test is passed;
 * Catered for rejection of seeds by align_top_subsequences.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.6  2006/01/31 08:21:19  tbailey
 * Changed way functions are passed to create_heap
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.5  2006/01/30 06:06:46  twhitington
 * Introduced serial number variable to seed objects.
 * Introduced str_seed variable to seed objects.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.4  2006/01/27 07:32:47  twhitington
 * Debugging changes made to subseq7.c, and debugging problems with get_key
 * in seed.c.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.3  2006/01/19 04:59:08  twhitington
 * Introduced heap objects to S_POINT objects. Changed get_nsites0 and get_starts accordingly, in starts.c. Corresponding changes were required in the seed interface and the Makefile.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.2  2006/01/18 07:09:08  twhitington
 * Implemented SEED object. Also introduced seed-tests program for testing SEED objects.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.2.1  2006/01/16 06:04:36  tbailey
 * Add seed.c and seed.h for branching project.
