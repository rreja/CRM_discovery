    <h2>Markov Background Model Format</h2>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <div class="indent">
      <p>This file format is used by many programs in the MEME Suite to model
      background probabilities. Most of the MEME Suite programs only use the
      0-order model though it doesn't matter if the higher order information
      is in the file, it will be silently ignored.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Format Specification</h3>
    <div class="indent">
      <p>Each line may contain either:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Any number of white-space characters including empty lines.</li>
        <li>A unique letter chain and a probability
        separated and potentially surrounded by whitespace.</li>
        <li>One of the other options followed by a "#" character designating
        the rest of the line as a comment to be ignored.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The letter chains are defined as one or more letters from either
      the DNA alphabet <b>ACGT</b> or the protein alphabet
      <b>ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY</b>. If any letter chains specify letters that
      only appear in the protein alphabet then the background is assumed to be
      for the protein alphabet, otherwise it is assumed to be for the DNA
      alphabet.</p>

      <p>The probabilities are numbers in the range 0 &le; <b>p</b> &le; 1.
      The may be in simple decimal (e.g., 0.00015) or use exponential notation (e.g., 1.5e-4).
      To be precise, each probability is a number <b>p</b>, where
      <b>p</b> can be matched by the regular expression
      <code>^([0]|[1-9][0-9]*)(\.[0-9]+)?([eE][+-]?[0-9]+)?$</code>
      and is in the range 0 &le; <b>p</b> &le; 1.</p>

      <p>Each non-empty, non-comment line defines a letter chain and a
      probability for seeing that sequence of letters. For example a line
      with an <b>A 0.25</b> defines the probability of seeing an "A" as 25%.
      If however the line had <b>CGA 0.15625</b> then it would define the
      probability of seeing the sequence "CGA" as approximately 1.6%.</p>
      
      <p>The summed probabilities of all chains of the same length should be
      approximately 1 (small allowances for rounding are made). Also the summed
      probabilities of all chains of the same length with a specific suffix
      should approximately equal the probability of that suffix.</p>

      <p>It is important to note that probabilities of zero (or one)
      are not allowed because these cause asymptotic conditions in the equations
      used by our programs. They are also unlikely to be correct - just because
      the dataset used to calculate a background might not contain any instances
      of "CGAAA" does not mean that it is impossible. For this reason the tool
      <a href="fasta-get-markov.html">fasta-get-markov</a> automatically adds
      pseudocounts unless it is specifically told not to.</p>

      <p>The file must contain a chain and probability pair for each possible
      alphabet chain length up to N + 1, where N is the "order" of the Markov model.
      Additionally the lines must be sorted by increasing chain length so the
      chain + probability pairs for the 0-order model with letter sequences of
      length 1 appear at the top and the Nth-order model with letter sequences
      of length N + 1 appear at the bottom.</p>
      
      <p>For example, a 0-order Markov model file might contain:</p>
      <pre class="indent">
#   order 0
a       0.324
c       0.176
g       0.176
t       0.324
      </pre>
      <p>A 1st-order Markov model file might contain:</p>
      <pre class="indent">
#   order 0
A       2.563e-01
C       2.437e-01
G       2.437e-01
T       2.563e-01
#   order 1
